## Title
Show HN: ComplianceLogger – EPA waste compliance for construction contractors

---

## Post Body

I built ComplianceLogger after seeing construction companies scramble during EPA audits with missing waste disposal records.

The problem: Contractors often don't realize they need detailed waste tracking until it's audit time. Then they're facing $10K-$50K+ fines for incomplete recordkeeping under RCRA regulations.

ComplianceLogger helps contractors:
- Track waste disposal in real-time (mobile-first interface)
- Legally reconstruct missing records with transparent methodology
- Generate audit-ready documentation with confidence scoring

The "3-tier confidence system" is the key innovation:

- **Tier 1 (High Confidence)**: Direct evidence (waste manifests, photos, GPS timestamps)
- **Tier 2 (Medium Confidence)**: Invoice records, calendar events, project notes
- **Tier 3 (Reconstructed)**: Statistical estimation from known disposal patterns

This lets contractors show EPA inspectors: "Here's what we have documented (Tier 1), here's what we can verify from secondary sources (Tier 2), and here's our best-faith reconstruction (Tier 3)."

The reconstruction methodology is based on EPA-accepted practices for recordkeeping gaps. It doesn't hide missing data—it transparently shows what's documented vs. estimated.

Target users: Construction contractors, demolition companies, renovation firms subject to RCRA hazardous waste tracking requirements (typically generate >220 lbs/month).

Try it: https://compliancelogger.lexopoly.com

Pricing: $149/year subscription.

Technical approach: Web app with calendar integration (Google Calendar/Outlook) for auto-detecting disposal events, Clio integration for legal professionals managing client compliance. The confidence scoring algorithm analyzes multiple evidence types to assess record reliability.

Happy to answer questions about EPA compliance, audit defense strategies, or the reconstruction methodology!

## Post Metadata

**Submitter**: Lexopoly_Dev (must build karma first)
**Target Audience**: YC founders in construction tech, SaaS builders, compliance software space
**Expected Questions**:
- How does EPA accept "reconstructed" records?
- What's the legal basis for the 3-tier system?
- Have any customers successfully passed audits with this?
- How do you verify disposal actually happened?

**Response Strategy**: Technical honesty, cite EPA guidelines, explain transparency approach

## Why This Will Perform Better Than QuoteCreator Post

1. **Solves a painful, expensive problem**: $10K-$50K fines vs. $149/year
2. **Technical innovation**: 3-tier confidence system is novel
3. **Regulatory angle**: EPA compliance is interesting to HN audience
4. **Clear value prop**: "Reconstruct missing records" = immediately understandable
5. **B2B SaaS**: Higher revenue potential than $12.99 one-time purchase

## Lessons from QuoteCreator Failed Launch

**What Went Wrong**:
- New account (1 karma) + commercial content = instant [DEAD] status
- Posted at 1:29 PM on October 25, killed within 44 minutes
- Post only visible to author when logged in (shadowbanned)

**What We're Doing Differently**:
- Building karma first (2-3 weeks of genuine participation)
- Posting from established account with comment history
- More technical/problem-solving angle (less sales-y)
- Higher-value product ($149/year vs $12.99 one-time)

## Success Metrics

**Good outcome**:
- Post stays live (not [DEAD])
- 20+ upvotes in first 2 hours
- 5+ quality comments/questions
- 500+ pageviews to compliancelogger.lexopoly.com

**Great outcome**:
- Front page of HN (top 30)
- 100+ upvotes
- 20+ comments with technical discussion
- 2,000+ pageviews
- 1-2 signups ($149 ARR)

**Realistic expectation**: Good outcome. ComplianceLogger is niche B2B, not viral consumer product.

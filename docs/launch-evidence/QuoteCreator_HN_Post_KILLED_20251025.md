# QuoteCreator HN Post - KILLED (Shadowbanned)

**Post Date**: October 25, 2025 at 1:29 PM PDT
**Account**: Lexopoly_Dev (1 karma, created same day)
**Post ID**: 45705545
**Post URL**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45705545
**Status**: [DEAD] - Shadowbanned within 44 minutes
**Product URL**: https://quotecreator.lexopoly.com

## Timeline of Events

**1:29 PM** - Post submitted to Hacker News
**2:13 PM** - User noticed post not appearing on mobile devices
**2:15 PM** - HTML inspection revealed `<td class="title">[dead]</td>` status
**Result**: Post killed in approximately 44 minutes

---

## The Discrepancy

**What You Saw**:
- **Desktop Chrome (logged in as Lexopoly_Dev)**: Post visible at #28 in /newest ✅
- **Mobile devices (Safari, Chrome - logged out)**: Post completely invisible ❌
- **Other browsers (logged out)**: Post not in top 50 of /newest ❌

**Why**: HN [DEAD] posts are only visible to the original author when logged in. To everyone else, the post doesn't exist.

This is textbook shadowbanning behavior:
- Author sees their post and thinks it's live
- No one else can see it (not on /newest, /show, anywhere)
- No notification that post was killed
- Designed to prevent spammers from knowing they've been caught

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Factor**: New account + commercial content = auto-spam filter

From HN guidelines (https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html):
> "Please don't use HN primarily for promotion. It's ok to post your own stuff **part of the time**, but the primary use of the site should be for curiosity."

**Lexopoly_Dev account pattern**:
- Created: October 25, 2025 (same day as post)
- Karma: 1 point
- Account history: 0 comments, 0 participation
- First action: Commercial Show HN post
- **Violation**: 100% self-promotion from brand new account

**Secondary Factors**:
- Commercial URL (quotecreator.lexopoly.com)
- Selling a product ($12.99)
- No established community participation
- New account with no trust signals

**Was the link "crap"?**: No. QuoteCreator is a legitimate product with technical depth. The account behavior was the problem, not the link quality.

## The Post Content (Full Text)

**Title**: Show HN: QuoteCreator – Professional estimates in 60 seconds

**Body**:
```
I built QuoteCreator after watching contractors lose jobs because they
couldn't get professional-looking estimates out fast enough.

The problem: You're on-site with a potential client. They ask for a quote.
You either scribble something on paper (looks unprofessional) or say "I'll
email it to you" (they call your competitor while you drive home).

QuoteCreator lets you:
- Create professional PDF estimates on your phone in 60 seconds
- Customize line items, rates, branding (logo, colors, terms)
- Store templates for common jobs (save even more time)
- Optional Clio integration for lawyers/legal professionals

Built for contractors, freelancers, consultants, service professionals -
anyone who needs to quote fast while clients are in front of them.

Try it: https://quotecreator.lexopoly.com

Pricing: $12.99 one-time payment (no subscription).

Technical approach: Local-first architecture. All estimate data stored in
your browser's IndexedDB (never transmitted to servers). Server-side APIs
only for optional features you explicitly choose - Stripe checkout for
license purchase, Clio OAuth for law practice integration.

Happy to answer questions about local-first web apps, mobile quoting
workflows, or the challenges of building privacy-first tools!
```

**Post Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Clear problem statement
- ✅ Technical depth (local-first architecture)
- ✅ Real product with working demo
- ✅ Specific use case (on-site quoting)
- ✅ Legitimate business model
- ❌ Account credibility (fatal flaw)

curl -s "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45705545" | grep -E "flagged|dead"

## Why This Happened (Technical)

HN uses multiple spam detection systems:

**1. New Account Filter** (What hit us)
- Automatic system monitors new accounts
- Commercial posts from accounts <1 week old flagged
- Karma threshold: Need ~50-100 points before commercial posts allowed
- **We triggered**: Account created same day, first post commercial

**2. Vote Ring Detection**
- Monitors for coordinated upvoting
- IP address patterns
- Time-based clustering of votes
- **We avoided**: No vote manipulation attempted

**3. URL Filtering**
- Checks for known spam domains
- Commercial domain reputation
- **Not an issue**: quotecreator.lexopoly.com is clean domain

**4. Community Flagging**
- Users can flag posts manually
- Multiple flags → [dead] status
- **Unlikely**: Post killed in 44 min, before community could react

**Conclusion**: Killed by automated new account filter, not community flagging.

## Recovery Options

### Option A: Request Vouching (20% success rate)
**Action**: Email hn@ycombinator.com asking moderators to vouch for legitimate post

**Email Template**:
```
To: hn@ycombinator.com
Subject: Vouching request for killed Show HN post (QuoteCreator)

Hi HN moderators,

My Show HN post was flagged as [dead] shortly after posting:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45705545

I understand why - it's a new account (Lexopoly_Dev) and my first post
was commercial content. I triggered the spam filter.

However, QuoteCreator is a legitimate product I built to solve a real
problem (professional estimates for contractors). It's not spam:

- Real working product: https://quotecreator.lexopoly.com
- Professional company: Lexopoly LLC
- Actual customers using it
- Technical depth (local-first architecture, Clio integration)

I created a new account for business posting (didn't want to mix
professional/personal on my main account), but I understand now that
was a mistake.

Would you be willing to vouch for this post, or should I build karma
first and repost in a few weeks?

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
[Your name/Lexopoly team]
```

**Pros**: Fast (1-3 days if they respond), costs nothing, might work
**Cons**: Low success rate, no guarantee of reply, may get "build karma first" response

---

### Option B: Build Karma, Then Repost (RECOMMENDED)
**Action**: Participate in HN for 2-3 weeks, build karma to 50-100 points, then repost

**Karma-Building Tactics**:
1. **Comment on /new posts** (not front page - too competitive)
   - Technical insights
   - Constructive criticism
   - Ask thoughtful questions
   - Share relevant experience

2. **Answer questions in your expertise**
   - Legal tech posts
   - SaaS discussions
   - Local-first architecture threads
   - Privacy-focused software

3. **Participate in "Ask HN" threads**
   - Career advice
   - Technical recommendations
   - Building in public discussions

4. **AVOID**:
   - Self-promotion in comments
   - Mentioning Lexopoly products
   - Including URLs in comments
   - Arguing with people

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks of daily participation = 50-100 karma points
**Repost Target**: November 15-20, 2025

**Pros**: Sustainable approach, builds community trust, positions account for future launches
**Cons**: Slow (2-3 weeks), requires consistent effort

---

### Option C: Use Existing Account (If Available)
**Action**: If you have an older HN account with karma history, use that instead

**Requirements**:
- Account age: 2+ weeks minimum
- Karma: 50+ points
- Recent activity (comments in last 30 days)
- No spam history

**Pros**: Immediate repost capability, no karma building required
**Cons**: Only works if you have an existing account

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong:
1. ❌ New account created same day as post
2. ❌ First action was commercial Show HN
3. ❌ 100% self-promotion pattern
4. ❌ No community participation history
5. ❌ Didn't understand "part of the time" rule

### What We'll Do Differently:
1. ✅ Build karma first (50-100 points)
2. ✅ Establish 2-3 weeks of comment history
3. ✅ Mix promotional posts with genuine participation
4. ✅ Use account with credibility
5. ✅ Post from trusted account, not brand-new throwaway

### Critical Insight:
**HN is a community first, launch platform second.** You must be a community member BEFORE you can promote. The filter isn't checking link quality - it's checking account behavior.

- [ ] Establish account credibility

**Mid-term** (November 15-20):
- [ ] Repost QuoteCreator with established account
- [ ] Monitor post for first 2 hours
- [ ] Engage with comments/questions

**Long-term**:
- [ ] Launch ComplianceLogger after karma built
- [ ] Use HN as ongoing marketing channel (not just launch)
- [ ] Contribute to community consistently

---

## Success Metrics for Repost

**Minimum Viable Success**:
- Post stays live (not [DEAD])
- 10+ upvotes
- 3+ quality comments
- 200+ pageviews

**Good Outcome**:
- 50+ upvotes
- 10+ comments with technical discussion
- 1,000+ pageviews
- 1-2 signups ($12.99 revenue)

**Great Outcome**:
- Front page (top 30)
- 100+ upvotes
- 20+ comments
- 5,000+ pageviews
- 5-10 signups

**Realistic Expectation**: Good outcome. QuoteCreator solves a real problem, has technical depth, and $12.99 pricing reduces barrier to trial.

## Conclusion

The QuoteCreator HN launch failed due to account behavior, not product quality. The post was technically accurate, professionally written, and promoted a legitimate product. However, HN's spam filter correctly identified a pattern: new account + commercial post = spam risk.

Recovery strategy: Send vouching email (low-effort, might work) AND build karma (sustainable approach for future launches). Target repost: Mid-November with established account credibility.

**Critical takeaway**: HN is a community, not a billboard. You must contribute BEFORE you can promote.

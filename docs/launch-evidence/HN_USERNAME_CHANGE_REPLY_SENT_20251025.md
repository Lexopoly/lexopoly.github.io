## Username Analysis: "Lex_O.P._Lee"

**Format**: Lex O.P. Lee (reads as personal name)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Sounds like a person's name (first + middle initials + surname)
- ✅ Not explicitly "Lexopoly" (though "Lex" is first syllable)
- ✅ Has character/personality
- ✅ Memorable and professional

**Potential Concern**:
- ⚠️ "Lex" might still reference "Lexopoly"
- Mod might push back if they make the connection

**Likely Outcome**:
- 80% chance: Mod accepts it (reads as personal name)
- 15% chance: Mod suggests removing "Lex" (too brand-related)
- 5% chance: Other feedback

**Backup usernames** (if needed):
- `op_lee` (removes "Lex" entirely)
- `builder_lee`
- `wyoming_dev`

---

## Expected Next Steps

### Best Case (Most Likely):

**Timeline**: 10 minutes to 4 hours

**Sequence**:
1. Mod changes username: `Lexopoly_Dev` → `Lex_O.P._Lee`
2. Mod vouches for post: Removes [DEAD] flag from #45705545
3. Mod replies: "Done!" or similar confirmation
4. Post goes live, appears in /newest

**Your action when confirmed**:
- Open post in incognito browser to verify
- Start monitoring immediately (first 2 hours critical)
- Respond to any comments within 5-10 minutes

### Alternate Scenario (Less Likely):

**Mod pushes back on "Lex_O.P._Lee"**:

**Example pushback**:
```
"Lex_O.P._Lee still sounds brand-related (Lex = Lexopoly).
Can you pick something more neutral?"
```

**Your response** (ready to send):
```
Totally understand! How about one of these instead?
- op_lee
- builder_lee
- wyoming_dev

Happy to use whichever you think fits HN culture best.
```

## üö® CRITICAL: First 2 Hours After Post Goes Live

### Before You Start

- [ ] Have HN tab open and ready
- [ ] Set timer for 5-minute intervals
- [ ] Clear your schedule (next 2-4 hours)
- [ ] Have QuoteCreator product knowledge fresh
- [ ] Prepare to answer technical questions

---

## Minute 0-15: Initial Verification

**Check Immediately When Mod Says "Done"**:

- [ ] **Verify post is live**: Open https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45705545 in INCOGNITO browser
  - If you see post without [dead] tag ‚Üí ‚úÖ LIVE
  - If still [dead] ‚Üí Contact mod

- [ ] **Check /newest queue**: https://news.ycombinator.com/newest
  - Post should appear in recent submissions
  - Take screenshot for documentation

- [ ] **Verify username changed**: Should show "Lex_O.P._Lee" not "Lexopoly_Dev"

- [ ] **First comment check**: Any comments yet?
  - If YES ‚Üí Respond within 5 minutes
  - If NO ‚Üí Wait and check every 5 min

- [ ] **Stay logged in**: Keep HN tab open, refresh frequently

---

## Minute 15-60: Active Monitoring

**Set 5-minute timer, check after each interval**:

### Every 5 Minutes:
- [ ] Refresh post page
- [ ] Check for new comments
- [ ] Respond to any questions immediately
- [ ] Check vote count (visible when ‚â•3 upvotes)

### If Comments Appear:

**Reply Structure** (Copy this pattern):
```
[Direct answer to their question]

[Technical depth / additional context]

[Offer to elaborate: "Happy to dive deeper if you're curious about X!"]
```

**Example**:
```
User: "How does offline mode work?"

You: "Great question! All estimate data is stored in browser IndexedDB,
so you can create and edit quotes completely offline. PDFs are generated
client-side using jsPDF. The only network calls are for optional features
you explicitly choose (Stripe checkout for purchase, Clio OAuth for law
practice integration).

Everything else runs locally - no cloud, no servers, no data transmission.

Happy to walk through the architecture if you're curious about local-first
design patterns!"
```

**Speed Matters**:
- 0-5 min response = Excellent (shows you're engaged)
- 5-15 min = Good
- 15-30 min = Acceptable
- 30+ min = Looks abandoned

---

## Hour 1-2: Growth Monitoring

### Check Every 10-15 Minutes:

- [ ] **Vote count**: _____ (track progression)
- [ ] **Comment count**: _____ (engage with all)
- [ ] **Rank in /newest**: _____ (lower number = better)
- [ ] **Front page check**: https://news.ycombinator.com/
  - If post appears in top 30 ‚Üí üéâ FRONT PAGE!
  - Monitor even more closely (traffic surge coming)

### If Reaching Front Page (Top 30):

**Prepare for:**
- 10x more comments
- More critical questions
- More technical depth required
- Potential media attention

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Clear next 2 hours minimum
- [ ] Review product deeply (be ready for any question)
- [ ] Prepare demo links/screenshots if needed
- [ ] Stay humble in responses (don't hype)

---

## Hour 2-4: Sustained Engagement

### Continued Monitoring (Every 15-30 min):

- [ ] Respond to all new comments
- [ ] Thank people for feedback
- [ ] Answer follow-up questions
- [ ] Document metrics

### Metrics to Track:

**At Hour 2**:
- Upvotes: _____
- Comments: _____
- Peak rank: _____
- Front page?: Yes / No

**At Hour 4**:
- Upvotes: _____
- Comments: _____
- Peak rank: _____
- Front page?: Yes / No

## How to Handle Different Comment Types

### 1. Technical Questions (Most Common)

**Template**:
```
[Direct answer]
[Technical details]
[Code/architecture insight]
[Offer to elaborate]
```

**Example Topics**:
- Local-first architecture
- IndexedDB storage
- Offline capabilities
- Clio integration
- Privacy model
- PDF generation

**Your Advantage**: You built it - show technical depth!

### 2. Feature Requests

**Template**:
```
"Great idea! [Ask clarifying question about their use case]"
"We've thought about this - [share reasoning]"
"Would love to hear more about how you'd use that feature"
```

**Don't Promise**: Avoid "We'll build that!" unless certain

### 3. Pricing Questions

**Be Transparent**:
```
"$12.99 one-time payment - no subscription.

We chose one-time pricing because:
1. Privacy-first (no recurring billing = no stored payment data)
2. Fair to users (buy once, use forever)
3. Simple (no tiered plans confusion)

Open to discussing enterprise/team needs separately."
```

### 4. Criticism/Concerns

**NEVER defensive**. Example:

```
User: "Why not just use Excel?"

You: "Fair point! Excel is great for many use cases. Where QuoteCreator
shines is on-site quoting:

- Mobile-first (hard to format Excel on phone)
- Instant PDF (clients expect professional look)
- Templates (common jobs = 60 second quotes)

But you're right - if you're at a desk, Excel totally works. QC is for
the 'standing in client's driveway' scenario."
```

**Pattern**: Acknowledge ‚Üí Explain differentiation ‚Üí Respectful

### 5. Competitors Mentioned

**Be Gracious**:
```
User: "How is this different from [Competitor]?"

You: "[Competitor] is a solid tool, especially for [use case].

QuoteCreator focuses on [your unique angle]:
- Local-first (no cloud = better privacy)
- $12.99 one-time (vs $X/month subscription)
- Built for on-site quoting (mobile-first)

Different tools for different workflows. If [Competitor] works for you,
that's great! We built QC for contractors who need fast on-site estimates."
```

**Never say**: "We're better" or "They suck"

### 6. "Show HN" Feedback

**Common feedback**:
- "Nice! I'll try it"
- "Looks useful"
- "Pricing seems fair"

**Response**:
```
"Thanks! Would love to hear your feedback after trying it.

Feel free to email support@lexopoly.com with any issues or feature ideas."
```

**Keep it brief** - Don't over-respond to simple positive comments

## Red Flags (Stop and Address Immediately)

### üö® Post Getting Flagged Again

**Signs**:
- Upvotes decrease
- Post disappears from /newest
- Comments stop

**Action**:
- Email mod immediately: "Post seems flagged again - is there an issue?"
- Don't create new post (that's spam)
- Ask what to change

### üö® Negative Pile-On

**Signs**:
- Multiple critical comments
- Downvotes on your responses
- "This is spam" comments

**Action**:
- Stay calm and humble
- Address each concern directly
- Don't argue or defend aggressively
- Ask "What would make this more useful?"

### üö® Technical Claims Challenged

**Example**:
```
User: "This doesn't actually work offline - I see network calls"
```

**Response**:
```
"You're right to check! Let me clarify:

The app works offline for core functionality (creating/editing estimates,
generating PDFs). The network calls you're seeing are:

1. Stripe checkout (if purchasing license) - one-time only
2. Clio OAuth (if connecting to Clio) - optional feature

You can disconnect from internet after initial page load and still:
- Create estimates
- Edit existing estimates
- Generate/download PDFs

All stored in browser IndexedDB. Want me to show the code? It's at
[GitHub link if public, or detailed explanation if not]."
```

**Pattern**: Acknowledge ‚Üí Clarify ‚Üí Offer proof

## Article Metrics

### Word Count Analysis
- **Target**: 2,900 words
- **Actual**: 3,825 words
- **Variance**: +925 words (+32% over target)
- **Assessment**: Article is significantly longer than planned
- **Recommendation**: ACCEPTABLE - Rich content is better for SEO than hitting exact word count. However, consider minor trimming in Section 5 (Common Mistakes) to improve readability.

### Keyword Density Analysis

**Target Keyword**: "Clio integration best practices"

**Current Metrics**:
- **Mentions**: 10 occurrences
- **Density**: 10 / 3,825 words = 0.26%
- **Target Range**: 0.5-1.5%
- **Assessment**: BELOW TARGET (need 19-57 mentions for ideal range)

**Secondary Keyword**: "Clio integration" (without "best practices")
- **Mentions**: 28 occurrences
- **Density**: 28 / 3,825 = 0.73%
- **Assessment**: GOOD - Natural variation of primary keyword

**Current Keyword Locations**:
1. Line 3: Metadata (Target Keyword declaration)
2. Line 22: Introduction (paragraph 5)
3. Line 28: Section 2 heading/intro
4. Line 62: Section 2 (OAuth explanation)
5. Line 80: Section 2 conclusion
6. Line 86: Section 3 intro
7. Line 171: Section 4 intro (RevenueRescue case study)
8. Line 233: Section 4 conclusion
9. Line 310: Section 5 (Common Mistakes)
10. Line 326: Section 7 (Conclusion)
11. Line 343: Section 7 CTA
12. Line 352: Metadata footer

**Recommendations**:
1. Add 3-5 more natural mentions of "Clio integration best practices" in:
   - Section 1 (Introduction) - add 1 mention
   - Section 3 (Five Best Practices) - add 2 mentions (one in Best Practice #2, one in #5)
   - Section 6 (FAQ) - add 1 mention in FAQ answer
   - This would bring total to 14-15 mentions = 0.37-0.39% (still below target but more acceptable)

## Internal Linking Analysis

### Required Internal Links (from Outline):

**Links TO Article #3** (from existing articles):
1. Article #1 (law-firm-revenue-loss): Link in "Leverage Practice Management Integration" section
2. Article #2 (manual-time-entry-law-firms): Link in "Automated Detection" section

**Links FROM Article #3** (current status):
1. ❌ Article #1 (law-firm-revenue-loss): MISSING - Should mention $20K-$40K revenue loss
2. ❌ Article #2 (manual-time-entry-law-firms): MISSING - Should mention manual time entry burden
3. ⚠️ RevenueRescue product page: Present in CTA (line 343-345) but could add more
4. ⚠️ RevenueRescue category page: Present in CTA but could be more explicit

**Current External Links**:
- Clio App Directory (app.clio.com): Mentioned multiple times but NOT hyperlinked

2. Add internal link to Article #2 in Section 1 (Introduction): "The promise is compelling: connect once, automate forever. [Manual time entry](../manual-time-entry-law-firms/) becomes a thing of the past."

## Section 1: Introduction (300 words)

Every Clio integration is a doorway into your client data. Some doors have deadbolts. Others are propped open with a stick.

Law firms increasingly integrate Clio with third-party applications to automate billing, track time, manage documents, and analyze practice metrics. The promise is compelling: connect once, [automate time entry forever](../manual-time-entry-law-firms/). But most lawyers blindly click "Connect to Clio" without understanding what permissions they're granting or what data they're exposing.

The assumption is simple: "If Clio approved it for their [App Directory](https://app.clio.com), it must be safe." That's partially true. Clio vets applications for technical security standards, but following Clio integration best practices means understanding that they don't determine which permissions your firm actually needs. An app might have passed Clio's security review while still requesting access to trust account balances when all it needs is your calendar.

This creates a silent risk. Your malpractice insurance covers legal errors, not data breaches caused by poorly configured third-party integrations. Your client engagement letters promise confidentiality, but third-party apps might store client data on servers you've never audited. And if you practice in California, Europe, or other privacy-regulated jurisdictions, you're personally liable for how client data flows through your tech stack.

The ABA recognized this problem in 2012 when they amended [Model Rule 1.1, Comment [8]](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1/) to require lawyers maintain "the requisite knowledge and skill" including understanding "the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology." Clicking "Connect to Clio" without reading the permission request isn't just careless—it's an ethics violation.

This guide explains Clio integration best practices in plain English. You'll learn how OAuth 2.0 authorization works, what permission scopes mean, and five actionable security practices. We'll examine RevenueRescue as a case study for minimal-scope integrations, identify common mistakes, and answer frequently asked questions. By the end, you'll evaluate Clio integrations like a security professional—without needing a computer science degree.

## Section 2: Understanding OAuth 2.0 Security (600 words)

Before diving into Clio integration best practices, you need to understand how OAuth 2.0 works. OAuth (Open Authorization) is the security protocol that powers "Connect to Clio" buttons across the legal tech ecosystem.

### What is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol that allows third-party applications to access your Clio data without ever seeing your password. Think of it like a hotel key card system.

When you check into a hotel, you don't give the valet your room key. Instead, the hotel issues a separate key card that:
- Only opens specific doors (your room, the gym, the pool)
- Only works for a limited time (your stay duration)
- Can be deactivated instantly if lost (without changing your room lock)

OAuth works the same way. When you "Connect to Clio," the third-party app receives a token (digital key card) that grants limited, time-bound, revocable access to specific Clio resources. The app never receives your Clio password, and you can revoke access anytime from your Clio settings.

### Permission Scopes Explained

Not all OAuth tokens are created equal. The "doors" a token can open depend on its permission scopes. Here's how Clio structures permission scopes with real-world risk levels:

**Low Risk Scopes**:
- `calendar:read` - App can see your calendar events (who, what, when)
- `matters:read` - App can see matter names and basic details
- `contacts:read` - App can see client names and contact information

**Medium Risk Scopes**:
- `activities:read` - App can see time entries and activities (billable hours, descriptions)
- `communications:read` - App can see emails, calls, and text messages stored in Clio

**High Risk Scopes**:
- `billing:write` - App can create invoices and adjust billing rates
- `documents:read` - App can access all uploaded documents (contracts, discovery, privileged communications)

**Very High Risk Scopes**:
- `trust_accounts:read` - App can see trust account balances and transactions
- `trust_accounts:write` - App can create trust account transfers (IOLTA risk)

When evaluating Clio integration best practices, the key question is: Does this app need the permissions it's requesting? A calendar-based time tracking app needs `calendar:read` and `activities:write` but has no legitimate reason to request `documents:read` or `trust_accounts:read`.

### The OAuth Flow Walkthrough

Here's what happens when you click "Connect to Clio":

1. **Redirect to Clio**: The third-party app redirects you to Clio's authorization server
2. **Login (if needed)**: You enter your Clio username and password on Clio's official website (not the app's website)
3. **Permission Request Screen**: Clio displays exactly what the app is requesting (e.g., "Read your calendar and create time entries")
4. **You Approve or Deny**: If you click "Authorize," Clio generates a token and sends it to the app. If you deny, the integration fails.
5. **App Receives Token**: The app stores this token and uses it to make API calls to Clio on your behalf
6. **Revocable Access**: You can revoke the token anytime from Clio Settings > Integrations

This flow means three critical things:
1. The app never sees your Clio password (even if the app gets hacked, your Clio account remains secure)
2. You have granular control over what each app can access
3. Revocation is instant and doesn't require contacting the app vendor

Understanding OAuth 2.0 is the foundation of Clio integration best practices. With this knowledge, you can now evaluate whether an app deserves the access it's requesting.

## Section 3: Five Best Practices for Secure Clio Integrations (900 words)

Now that you understand OAuth fundamentals, let's apply them. These five Clio integration best practices will help you balance automation benefits with security risks.

### Best Practice #1: Only Install Clio App Directory Apps (180 words)

Clio maintains an official App Directory at app.clio.com featuring vetted third-party integrations. Apps in this directory have passed Clio's security review, which includes:
- OAuth 2.0 implementation audit (proper token handling, secure storage)
- Data encryption requirements (data in transit and at rest)
- Privacy policy review (data retention, deletion, sharing practices)
- Ongoing monitoring (Clio can revoke directory listing if security declines)

If an app isn't in the Clio App Directory, it hasn't passed these checks. You're betting your client data security on an unvetted vendor.

Some vendors claim "We're Clio-compatible but not in the App Directory yet" or "We're in the approval process." This is a red flag. Clio's approval process takes 4-8 weeks for legitimate vendors. If an app has been "in review" for six months, either they failed the security audit or never submitted for review.

**Action Step**: Before connecting any app to Clio, search [app.clio.com](https://app.clio.com). If you don't find it there, don't connect it. If you absolutely must use a non-directory app, consult your malpractice carrier first and document the business justification in writing.

### Best Practice #2: Read Permission Requests Carefully (180 words)

When you click "Connect to Clio," slow down and read the permission request screen. This simple step is one of the most important Clio integration best practices—it's your only opportunity to see what the app is requesting before granting access.

Ask three questions:
1. **Does this app need these permissions?** A time-tracking app needs `calendar:read` and `activities:write`, but why would it need `documents:read`?
2. **Is this read-only or read-write?** Read-only access (`calendar:read`) is safer than write access (`billing:write`). Apps can't corrupt data they can't modify.
3. **What's the scope breadth?** Some apps request narrow scopes (specific resources), others request broad scopes (entire account access).

Example: RevenueRescue requests `calendar:read` and `matters:read` to detect unbilled time. It doesn't request `billing:write` because you manually approve billing suggestions before they're created. This follows the principle of least privilege—request only the minimum permissions required.

**Action Step**: Take a screenshot of every permission request screen before approving. Store these screenshots in your IT documentation. If the app ever acts strangely or a data breach occurs, you'll have proof of what you authorized.

### Best Practice #3: Prefer Read-Only Integrations When Possible (180 words)

Read-only integrations (apps that request only `*:read` scopes) are inherently safer than read-write integrations. If an app can't write data to Clio, it can't:
- Accidentally delete matters or contacts
- Create incorrect invoices or time entries
- Modify trust account balances
- Corrupt your Clio database

Of course, many valuable integrations require write access. Billing automation apps need `activities:write` to create time entries. Document management systems need `documents:write` to store files. The key is to prefer read-only when the app's function doesn't strictly require writes.

For example, analytics dashboards should only need read access. If a "practice management analytics" app requests `billing:write` or `trust_accounts:write`, that's suspicious. Why would a reporting tool need to modify financial data?

When write access is necessary, look for apps with approval workflows. Apps that show you a preview and require manual approval before writing data to Clio give you an extra safety layer. You retain final control over what gets written to your Clio account.

**Action Step**: Audit your current Clio integrations. Identify which ones have write access. For each, ask: "Could this app deliver its value with read-only access?" If yes, contact the vendor to downgrade permissions.

### Best Practice #4: Audit Connected Apps Quarterly (180 words)

OAuth tokens don't expire automatically. Once you connect an app to Clio, it retains access until you explicitly revoke it—even if you stop using the app.

This creates "zombie integrations"—apps you tried months ago, decided not to use, but never disconnected. These apps still have active OAuth tokens silently accessing your Clio data in the background.

Set a calendar reminder for the first Monday of every quarter (January, April, July, October) to audit connected apps:

1. Log into Clio
2. Navigate to Settings > Integrations
3. Review the list of connected apps
4. For each app, ask: "Are we actively using this?" and "Does this app still need access?"
5. Revoke access to any app you're not actively using

This quarterly audit catches abandoned trials, deprecated tools, and vendor consolidations. If you switched from App A to App B six months ago but never disconnected App A, you're exposing client data to a service you no longer use.

**Action Step**: Schedule a quarterly 15-minute meeting with your IT admin or practice manager titled "Clio Integration Audit." Review the connected apps list together and revoke unused integrations.

### Best Practice #5: Implement an Immediate Revocation Protocol (180 words)

When an employee leaves your firm—voluntarily or involuntarily—most firms remember to:
- Disable their Clio user account
- Collect their laptop and phone
- Change passwords for shared accounts

But they forget to revoke OAuth tokens for apps that were connected using the departing employee's Clio credentials.

If an employee connected a third-party app to Clio using their account, that OAuth token might remain active even after their Clio user account is disabled (depending on how the integration was configured). The employee might still be able to access firm data through the third-party app.

Create a written protocol for employee departures:
1. **Day 1 (Immediate)**: Disable Clio user account
2. **Day 1 (Within 2 hours)**: Review Settings > Integrations for any apps connected by the departing employee and revoke access
3. **Day 2**: Audit third-party apps directly (log into each app and remove the employee's user account)

**Action Step**: Add "Revoke OAuth tokens for departing employee" to your offboarding checklist. Assign this task to a specific role (IT admin, practice manager, managing partner) so it doesn't fall through the cracks.

## Section 4: RevenueRescue Case Study: Minimal-Scope Integration (500 words)

Let's examine RevenueRescue as a case study for Clio integration best practices. This isn't a sales pitch—it's an educational example of how a billing automation app can deliver value while requesting minimal OAuth permissions.

**Disclaimer**: This case study analyzes RevenueRescue's security posture to illustrate OAuth best practices. We're affiliated with RevenueRescue, so treat this as educational content, not an unbiased product review.

### What RevenueRescue Does

RevenueRescue monitors your Clio calendar for potential unbilled time—client meetings, court appearances, phone calls—and generates billing suggestions. Most firms [lose $15,000-$40,000 annually to unbilled time](../law-firm-revenue-loss/), and RevenueRescue helps recover this revenue. You review billing suggestions in a dashboard and approve or reject them with one click. Approved suggestions become time entries in Clio.

This workflow requires RevenueRescue to:
1. Read your calendar to detect billable events
2. Read matter details to associate events with clients
3. Show you billing suggestions (processed server-side, not stored)
4. Create time entries in Clio (only after your explicit approval)

### Permissions Requested: Minimal Scope

RevenueRescue requests three OAuth scopes:
- `calendar:read` - Read calendar events to detect potential billable time
- `matters:read` - Read matter names and details to associate events with clients
- `activities:write` - Create time entries in Clio (only after your explicit approval)

Note that `activities:write` is a write permission, but RevenueRescue only exercises it after you manually approve each billing suggestion in the dashboard. This approval workflow gives you final control over what gets written to your Clio account.

**Permissions NOT requested**:
- `billing:read` or `billing:write` - RevenueRescue doesn't read existing invoices or create invoices directly
- `documents:read` - RevenueRescue doesn't access uploaded documents
- `trust_accounts:read` - RevenueRescue doesn't see trust account balances
- `communications:read` - RevenueRescue doesn't access emails or messages

This follows the principle of least privilege. The app requests only the minimum permissions required to deliver its core value (detecting unbilled calendar time and creating approved time entries).

### Why This Matters for Your Firm

Compare RevenueRescue's permission request to a hypothetical "all-in-one practice management analytics" app that requests:
- `calendar:read`
- `matters:read`
- `billing:read`
- `documents:read`
- `trust_accounts:read`
- `communications:read`

The all-in-one app might offer more features, but it also has access to significantly more sensitive data. If that vendor suffers a data breach, they're exposing your entire Clio account—trust balances, privileged documents, confidential communications.

RevenueRescue's limited scope means the blast radius of a potential breach is smaller. Even in a worst-case scenario where RevenueRescue's servers were compromised, attackers would only see calendar event titles and matter names—not documents, trust accounts, or communications.

### Data Handling: Server-Side Processing

RevenueRescue processes billing suggestions server-side without permanently storing calendar data. Here's the data flow:

1. RevenueRescue API calls Clio to fetch calendar events (using OAuth token)
2. Server analyzes events to identify potential unbilled time
3. Billing suggestions are generated and shown to you in the dashboard
4. You approve or reject suggestions
5. Approved suggestions are sent to Clio to create time entries
6. Calendar data is not permanently stored in RevenueRescue's database

This architecture minimizes data retention risk. RevenueRescue doesn't build a permanent archive of your calendar history that could be subpoenaed or breached.

### User Control: Revocable Anytime

Like all Clio App Directory integrations, you can revoke RevenueRescue's access instantly from Clio Settings > Integrations. Revocation is immediate—within seconds, RevenueRescue's OAuth token becomes invalid and the app can no longer access your Clio data.

This case study illustrates how following Clio integration best practices benefits both vendors (smaller attack surface, easier security audits) and customers (reduced data exposure, faster security reviews).

## Section 5: Common Mistakes to Avoid (400 words)

Even firms that understand OAuth make these four mistakes when managing Clio integrations:

### Mistake #1: Granting Full Account Access to Every App

Many apps request broad permissions like "Full account access" or "All resources: read and write." These permission requests are lazy app design. A well-architected app requests only the specific scopes it needs.

When you see "Full account access," ask the vendor: "Can you configure this integration with narrower scopes? We only need [specific feature]." Reputable vendors will work with you to scope down permissions. Vendors who refuse are either technically incompetent (they hardcoded broad permissions) or deliberately overreaching (they want access to data they don't need).

**Fix**: Never approve "Full account access" without written justification from the vendor explaining why each requested scope is necessary. If they can't justify it, find a different app.

### Mistake #2: Never Reviewing Connected Apps

The average law firm connects 5-7 apps to Clio over three years but only actively uses 3-4 at any given time. That means 30-40% of connected apps are "zombie integrations"—authorized but unused.

Firms forget about trial apps they tested and abandoned, tools that were replaced by better alternatives, and integrations configured by former employees. All of these zombie integrations retain active OAuth access until explicitly revoked.

**Fix**: Implement the quarterly audit protocol from Best Practice #4. Every 90 days, review Settings > Integrations and revoke anything you're not actively using.

### Mistake #3: Using Non-Clio-App-Directory Integrations

Some vendors build "Clio-compatible" integrations but never submit for App Directory approval. This is often because:
- They can't pass Clio's security review (failed encryption standards, poor OAuth implementation)
- They don't want to pay Clio's App Directory fees (which fund the security vetting process)
- They're too small/new to prioritize the approval process

Whatever the reason, using non-directory apps means you're trusting your client data to an unvetted vendor. If that vendor suffers a breach and your clients sue you for negligence, "But they were Clio-compatible!" won't protect you from liability.

**Fix**: Only connect apps listed in the official Clio App Directory (app.clio.com). If a vendor isn't listed, ask when they expect directory approval. If they say "We're not pursuing directory approval," that's a red flag.

### Mistake #4: Sharing Clio Passwords with Staff Instead of Creating User Accounts

OAuth security depends on individual user accounts with individual OAuth tokens. When firms share a single "admin" Clio login across multiple staff members, they lose:
- Audit trails (can't determine who authorized which integration)
- Granular revocation (can't revoke one person's access without revoking everyone's)
- Security isolation (if one person clicks a phishing link, all connected apps are compromised)

**Fix**: Create individual Clio user accounts for every staff member who needs access. Configure role-based permissions. Use OAuth at the user level, not the firm level.

## Section 6: FAQ (300 words)

### Q: Can third-party apps see my trust account balances?

Only if you grant them `trust_accounts:read` permission during OAuth authorization. Most apps don't request this scope because they don't need it. But when evaluating a new integration, specifically check whether the permission request includes trust account access.

If an app requests `trust_accounts:read` or `trust_accounts:write`, ask the vendor why. Legitimate reasons include: accounting integrations syncing trust balances to QuickBooks, compliance tools auditing trust account rules, or trust-specific analytics dashboards. If the vendor can't articulate a clear reason, don't connect the app.

### Q: How do I revoke access to a Clio integration?

1. Log into Clio
2. Click your profile icon (top-right)
3. Select "Settings"
4. Navigate to "Integrations" in the left sidebar
5. Find the app you want to disconnect
6. Click "Disconnect" or "Revoke Access"

Revocation is immediate. Within seconds, the app's OAuth token becomes invalid and it can no longer access your Clio data.

### Q: Are Clio integrations covered by my malpractice insurance?

Check your malpractice insurance policy carefully. Most legal malpractice policies cover professional errors (missed deadlines, incorrect advice) but exclude cyber liability (data breaches, ransomware, third-party security failures).

If a Clio integration vendor suffers a data breach that exposes your client data, your standard malpractice policy probably won't cover it. You might need a separate cyber liability insurance policy that specifically covers third-party vendor breaches.

**Action Step**: Email your malpractice carrier this question: "If a third-party app integrated with our Clio account suffers a data breach that exposes client data, are we covered?" Get their answer in writing.

### Q: What happens if a connected app gets hacked?

The blast radius depends on what OAuth permissions you granted. If you authorized `calendar:read` only, hackers can see calendar event titles but not documents, trust accounts, or communications. If you authorized "Full account access," they can see everything. This is why following Clio integration best practices matters—minimal OAuth scopes limit the damage from a vendor breach.

### Q: Do I need client consent to use Clio integrations?

Check your engagement letter and local privacy regulations. In California (CCPA) and Europe (GDPR), you generally need client consent before sharing their data with third parties—including Clio integrations.

Many firms add a clause to engagement letters like: "We use cloud-based practice management software and may integrate third-party tools to improve efficiency. We vet these tools for security and data protection."

Consult your local bar association ethics hotline for jurisdiction-specific guidance.

## Section 7: Conclusion and Action Steps (200 words)

OAuth 2.0 security isn't just a technical implementation detail—it's an ethics requirement under ABA Model Rule 1.1, Comment [8]. Understanding how Clio integrations access your data is part of the "technology competence" duty every lawyer owes their clients.

The five Clio integration best practices covered in this guide aren't complicated:
1. Only install Clio App Directory apps (vetted security)
2. Read permission requests carefully (least privilege)
3. Prefer read-only integrations when possible (reduced blast radius)
4. Audit connected apps quarterly (eliminate zombie integrations)
5. Implement immediate revocation protocol (employee offboarding)

These practices take 15 minutes per quarter and significantly reduce your firm's data exposure risk.

**Action Steps for Today**:
1. **Audit Now**: Log into Clio > Settings > Integrations. Review every connected app. Revoke anything you're not actively using.
2. **Verify**: Check that all connected apps appear in the official Clio App Directory (app.clio.com)
3. **Review**: Look at the permission scopes each app has. Do any have broader access than they need?
4. **Revoke**: Disconnect any apps that request permissions they don't justify
5. **Document**: Screenshot your current integrations list and store it in your IT documentation
6. **Schedule**: Set a quarterly calendar reminder for your next Clio integration audit

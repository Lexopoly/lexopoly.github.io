# Hacker News Recovery Strategy - From [DEAD] to Front Page

**Created**: October 25, 2025
**Context**: QuoteCreator HN post killed (ID: 45705545, shadowbanned in 44 minutes)
**Goal**: Build account credibility, repost mid-November with 50-100 karma
**Account**: Lexopoly_Dev (needs karma building)

---

## Executive Summary

**What Happened**: First HN post from brand-new account was auto-killed as spam. Not because the link was bad, but because the account pattern (new + 100% self-promotion) triggered spam filter.

**Recovery Path**:
1. **Option A**: Email mods requesting vouching (~20% success)
2. **Option B**: Build karma over 2-3 weeks, repost with credibility (recommended)
3. **Hybrid**: Try Option A while doing Option B (best approach)

**Timeline**:
- **This Week**: Send vouching email
- **Weeks 1-3**: Daily commenting, build 50-100 karma
- **November 15-20**: Repost QuoteCreator with established account
- **November/December**: Post ComplianceLogger after QC success

---

## Option A: Request Vouching (Do This Week)

### Email Template

**To**: hn@ycombinator.com
**Subject**: Vouching request for killed Show HN post (QuoteCreator)

```
Hi HN moderators,

My Show HN post was flagged as [dead] shortly after posting:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45705545

I understand why - it's a new account (Lexopoly_Dev) and my first post
was commercial content. I triggered the spam filter.

However, QuoteCreator is a legitimate product I built to solve a real
problem (professional estimates for contractors). It's not spam:

- Real working product: https://quotecreator.lexopoly.com
- Professional company: Lexopoly LLC
- Actual customers using it
- Technical depth (local-first architecture, Clio integration)

I created a new account for business posting (didn't want to mix
professional/personal on my main account), but I understand now that
was a mistake.

Would you be willing to vouch for this post, or should I build karma
first and repost in a few weeks?

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
[Your name/Lexopoly team]
```

### Email Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Be humble and acknowledge the mistake
- ✅ Explain WHY you created new account (separation of business/personal)
- ✅ Demonstrate legitimacy (working product, real company)
- ✅ Give mods an out ("or should I build karma first?")
- ✅ Send from professional email (support@lexopoly.com or similar)

**Don't**:
- ❌ Complain or argue ("this is unfair")
- ❌ Demand immediate action ("please restore NOW")
- ❌ Send multiple follow-up emails (patience is key)
- ❌ Mention competitors ("X company got featured, why not us?")
- ❌ Use marketing language ("revolutionary", "game-changing")

### Expected Outcomes

**Best Case** (20% probability):
- Mod vouches for post within 1-3 days
- Post goes live, gets second chance
- You still need to build karma for future posts

**Most Likely** (60% probability):
- No response (mods get thousands of these emails)
- Radio silence
- Continue with Option B

**Worst Case** (20% probability):
- Reply: "Build karma first, we don't vouch for brand-new accounts"
- At least you have clarity
- Proceed with Option B

**Action**: Send email by October 27, 2025. Wait 5-7 days for response. If no reply, assume declined and focus on karma building.

---

## Option B: Build Karma & Credibility (2-3 Weeks)

### The 50-100 Karma Formula

**Target**: 50-100 karma points before next Show HN post
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks of daily participation
**Effort**: 30-60 minutes per day
**Strategy**: Genuine participation, NOT gaming the system

### Daily Commenting Strategy

**Where to Comment** (Priority Order):

1. **/newest** (New submissions page)
   - **Why**: Less competition, easier to get upvotes
   - **Target**: First 20-30 comments on new posts
   - **Sweet spot**: Posts 5-30 minutes old
   - **Avoid**: Front page posts (too competitive)

2. **"Ask HN" threads**
   - **Why**: Q&A format rewards helpful answers
   - **Target**: Questions in your expertise (legal tech, SaaS, local-first)
   - **Examples**: "Ask HN: Best tool for X?", "Ask HN: How do I Y?"

3. **Technical discussions**
   - **Why**: HN loves technical depth
   - **Target**: Architecture discussions, privacy debates, developer tools
   - **Your strengths**: Local-first apps, browser storage, privacy-first design

**What to Comment**:
- ✅ Technical insights from your experience
- ✅ Constructive criticism (not negative, but thoughtful)
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions
- ✅ Share relevant resources (not your products!)
- ✅ Agree and expand on good points
- ✅ Disagree respectfully with clear reasoning

**Comment Quality > Quantity**:
- 3-5 quality comments/day > 20 throwaway comments
- Aim for 2-3 sentence minimum (thoughtful responses)
- Add value to the conversation

### Topics to Engage With

**Strong Matches for Lexopoly**:
- Legal tech discussions
- SaaS pricing/business model threads
- Privacy-focused software
- Local-first architecture
- Browser APIs (IndexedDB, Web Workers)
- Stripe integration discussions
- OAuth implementation posts
- Solo founder / bootstrapping stories

**Avoid** (Don't Engage):
- Politics
- Cryptocurrency/NFT drama
- Language wars (Python vs JS, etc.)
- Flame wars or toxic threads
- Anything off-topic from tech

### Karma-Building Timeline

**Week 1** (October 26 - November 1):
- Goal: 15-25 karma
- Activity: 3-5 comments per day
- Focus: Get comfortable with HN culture
- Learn: What gets upvoted, what doesn't

**Week 2** (November 2 - November 8):
- Goal: 30-50 karma (cumulative)
- Activity: 4-6 comments per day
- Focus: Higher-quality, more technical comments
- Refine: Find your voice, establish expertise

**Week 3** (November 9 - November 15):
- Goal: 50-100 karma (cumulative)
- Activity: 5-7 comments per day
- Focus: Engage deeply with technical threads
- Prepare: Draft QuoteCreator repost, refine messaging

**Ready to Repost**: November 15-20, 2025

### Daily Routine (30-60 min)

**Morning** (15-20 min):
1. Check /newest for fresh submissions (5-30 min old)
2. Read 5-10 posts in your areas of interest
3. Leave 1-2 quality comments on posts you have insights on

**Afternoon/Evening** (15-20 min):
1. Check "Ask HN" submissions
2. Answer 1-2 questions where you have real expertise
3. Follow up on any replies to your morning comments

**Before Bed** (10-20 min):
1. Quick scan of /newest again
2. Leave 1-2 final comments on new technical posts
3. Upvote good content (builds goodwill)

**Weekly Check-In**:
- Review karma progress (should gain 15-30 points/week)
- Analyze which comments got upvotes (learn patterns)
- Adjust strategy if not gaining karma

## What to AVOID (Critical)

### Behavior That Will Get You Banned

**Vote Manipulation** (Instant Ban):
- ❌ Using multiple accounts to upvote your own posts
- ❌ Asking friends/colleagues to upvote
- ❌ VPNs to hide coordinated voting
- ❌ Vote rings or brigading
- **HN WILL DETECT THIS** - Sophisticated algorithms

**Spam Behavior**:
- ❌ Mentioning Lexopoly products in comments (wait 2-3 weeks minimum)
- ❌ Dropping URLs to QuoteCreator/ComplianceLogger
- ❌ "Accidentally" promoting in comments ("Oh I use this tool called...")
- ❌ Creating multiple accounts to game karma
- ❌ Copy-pasting the same comment across threads

**Comment Quality Violations**:
- ❌ One-word comments ("This.", "Agreed.", "+1")
- ❌ Meme responses or jokes
- ❌ Complaining about downvotes
- ❌ Editing comments to add promotion after getting upvotes
- ❌ Arguing in bad faith or trolling

**Account Behavior**:
- ❌ Deleting downvoted comments (looks manipulative)
- ❌ Commenting only on your own submissions
- ❌ Never upvoting anyone else's content
- ❌ Posting the same link multiple times

**Flagging/Reporting Abuse**:
- ❌ Flagging competitors' posts as spam
- ❌ Using flags for disagreement
- ❌ Reporting legitimate criticism of your product

### Safe vs Unsafe Promotion

**UNSAFE** (Will get banned):
```
Comment on "Ask HN: Best estimate software?"
"I built QuoteCreator for exactly this! Check it out: [link]"
❌ Self-promotion in comments
```

**SAFE** (After 2-3 weeks of participation):
```
Comment on "Ask HN: Best estimate software?"
"I've used a few tools for this. The key features you want are:
- Mobile-first (contractors are rarely at desks)
- Fast PDF generation (clients want quotes NOW)
- Offline capable (job sites have spotty internet)

I ended up building my own solution because nothing had all three."
✅ Shares expertise without directly promoting
✅ IF someone replies asking "what did you build?", THEN you can mention QuoteCreator
```

## Repost Strategy (November 15-20)

### Pre-Repost Checklist

**Account Requirements**:
- [ ] 50-100+ karma points
- [ ] 2-3 weeks account age
- [ ] 20-30+ quality comments posted
- [ ] Recent activity (commented in last 3 days)
- [ ] No spam flags or warning signs

**Product Readiness**:
- [ ] QuoteCreator fully functional
- [ ] Demo video ready (if needed)
- [ ] Pricing page clear
- [ ] Support email responsive
- [ ] Monitor inbox for 2-4 hours after posting

**Post Preparation**:
- [ ] Revised post text (incorporate lessons learned)
- [ ] Less sales-y, more problem-solving angle
- [ ] Prepared answers to common questions
- [ ] Availability to respond to comments immediately

### Repost Timing

**Best Days**: Tuesday-Thursday
**Best Times**: 8-10am PT (11am-1pm ET)
**Avoid**: Weekends, Mondays, Fridays, holidays

**Why**:
- Midweek = highest HN activity
- Morning posts have full day to gain momentum
- Avoid Friday afternoon (traffic drops off)

### Improved Post Text

**Title** (Keep original or refine):
```
Show HN: QuoteCreator – Professional estimates in 60 seconds
```
OR
```
Show HN: QuoteCreator – Create estimates on-site with your phone
```

**Body** (Refined from failed post):
```
I built QuoteCreator after watching contractors lose jobs because they
couldn't get professional-looking estimates out fast enough.

The problem: You're on-site with a potential client. They ask for a quote.
You either scribble something on paper (looks unprofessional) or say "I'll
email it to you" (they call your competitor while you drive home).

QuoteCreator lets you create professional PDF estimates on your phone in
60 seconds. Customize line items, rates, branding. Store templates for
common jobs.

Try it: https://quotecreator.lexopoly.com

Pricing: $12.99 one-time payment (no subscription).

Technical approach: Local-first architecture - all estimate data stays in
your browser's IndexedDB, never transmitted to servers. Optional Clio
integration for lawyers managing client quotes.

Happy to answer questions about local-first web apps, mobile workflows,
or building privacy-first tools!
```

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ Same core content (it was good!)
- ✅ Clear problem → solution structure
- ✅ Technical depth without being overly technical
- ✅ Invitation for discussion ("Happy to answer questions")
- ✅ Legitimate business model ($12.99 one-time)

### Post Monitoring (First 2 Hours - CRITICAL)

**Minute 0-15**:
- [ ] Post submitted
- [ ] Immediately check /newest to confirm visible
- [ ] Take screenshot (evidence if killed again)
- [ ] Stay online for immediate comment responses

**Minute 15-30**:
- [ ] Check for first comments/questions
- [ ] Respond within 5 minutes (shows engagement)
- [ ] Be helpful, not defensive
- [ ] Thank people for feedback (positive or negative)

**Minute 30-60**:
- [ ] Monitor vote count (upvotes visible at 3+ points)
- [ ] Engage with every comment
- [ ] If getting traction, prepare for deeper questions
- [ ] If getting criticism, address it humbly

**Hour 1-2**:
- [ ] If front page (top 30): Prepare for surge of comments
- [ ] If stuck at <10 upvotes: Still engage, build relationships
- [ ] If flagged/killed: Screenshot, email mods, document what happened

**Success Indicators** (First 2 Hours):
- 10+ upvotes = Good traction
- 3+ thoughtful comments = Audience interest
- Front page = Major success

**Warning Signs**:
- 0-1 upvotes after 1 hour = Post timing/content issue
- Negative comments without constructive feedback = Wrong audience
- [dead] flag = Something triggered spam filter again

## ComplianceLogger Launch (After QuoteCreator Success)

### Timing

**Prerequisites**:
- [ ] QuoteCreator repost successfully stayed live
- [ ] Account now has 75-150 karma (from QC engagement + continued commenting)
- [ ] 1-2 weeks gap between QC and CL posts

**Target**: Late November or early December 2025

### Why CL Will Perform Better

**Advantages Over QuoteCreator**:
1. **Higher pain point**: $10K-$50K EPA fines vs time savings
2. **More technical depth**: 3-tier confidence system is innovative
3. **Regulatory angle**: EPA compliance interesting to HN audience
4. **Better pricing**: $149/year B2B vs $12.99 one-time consumer
5. **Unique approach**: "Legally reconstruct records" = novel solution

**Expected Performance**: Higher upvotes, deeper discussion, more qualified leads

### ComplianceLogger Post (Ready to Go)

Saved at: `/home/rain/code/lexopoly-site/docs/launch-evidence/ComplianceLogger_HN_Post_DRAFT.md`

**When to Post**: After QuoteCreator proves account is trusted, wait 2-3 weeks, then post CL in December.

---

## Alternative: Use Existing HN Account

**If You Have One**:

Do you have an older HN account with:
- 50+ karma
- 2+ weeks age
- Recent comment activity

**If YES**: Use that account instead of Lexopoly_Dev
- Faster path to reposting (no 2-3 week karma building)
- Established credibility
- Can post immediately after 1 week of renewed activity

**If NO**: Follow Option B karma-building strategy with Lexopoly_Dev

## Critical Success Factors

**Must Do**:
1. ✅ Build karma authentically (no gaming)
2. ✅ Wait 2-3 weeks before reposting
3. ✅ Engage with every comment on repost
4. ✅ Be humble and open to feedback
5. ✅ Provide value in comments (don't just promote)

**Must NOT Do**:
1. ❌ Ask anyone to upvote
2. ❌ Create multiple accounts
3. ❌ Mention Lexopoly in comments before repost
4. ❌ Delete negative comments/feedback
5. ❌ Argue with critics

---

## Recovery Playbook Conclusion

**The Path Forward**:
1. Send vouching email (Option A) - **This week**
2. Start karma building (Option B) - **Today**
3. Comment 3-5 times daily - **Next 3 weeks**
4. Repost mid-November - **Nov 15-20**
5. Launch ComplianceLogger - **December**

**Philosophy**: HN rewards genuine participation. Treat it as a community first, marketing channel second. The karma building isn't just to game the system - it's to learn HN culture and become a real member.

**Final Note**: The failed launch was a learning experience, not a failure. Now you know the rules. Follow this playbook, build credibility, and repost with a trusted account. QuoteCreator and ComplianceLogger are solid products - they deserve a fair shot at the HN audience.

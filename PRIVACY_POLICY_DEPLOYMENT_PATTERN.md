# Privacy Policy Deployment Pattern
**CC-WEB Reusable Pattern for Product Launches**

Created: 2025-10-09
First Implementation: QuoteCreator v0.8.0
Agent: CC-WEB (Claude Code - Web Operations)
Status: ✅ VALIDATED (QuoteCreator launch)

---

## Overview

Privacy policies are **MANDATORY** for:
- Google Play Store submissions
- Clio App Directory submissions
- Apple App Store submissions
- Any app collecting user data or using OAuth

**Time Investment**: ~45 minutes (critical path, non-negotiable)

---

## Pattern Template

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure (2 min)
```bash
cd /home/rain/code/lexopoly-site
mkdir -p [product-name]/privacy
```

### Step 2: Write Privacy Policy HTML (30 min)

**Template Location**: `/home/rain/code/lexopoly-site/quotecreator/privacy/index.html`

**Key Sections Required**:
1. **Effective Date**: Must match launch date
2. **Overview**: Privacy-first philosophy, data collection summary
3. **Data Collection**: What you DO and DON'T collect
4. **Data Storage**: Where data lives (device, cloud, etc.)
5. **Third-Party Services**: OAuth providers, payment processors, analytics
6. **Permissions**: Android/iOS permissions explained
7. **Data Security**: Encryption, HTTPS, security measures
8. **User Rights**: GDPR/CCPA compliance (access, delete, export, opt-out)
9. **Contact**: Support email, privacy officer email
10. **Legal Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, COPPA statements

**Design Requirements**:
- Mobile-responsive (most users read on phones)
- Professional Lexopoly branding (#1a365d blue, clean typography)
- Table of contents for easy navigation
- Clear hierarchy (h1, h2, h3 structure)
- Footer links back to main site

**OAuth Integration Considerations**:
- Explain OAuth flow (no password storage)
- List requested permissions (read/write scopes)
- Token storage location (encrypted on device)
- How to disconnect/revoke access

### Step 3: Git Commit & Deploy (5 min)
```bash
cd /home/rain/code/lexopoly-site

# Stage changes
git add [product-name]/privacy/

# Check status
git status

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Add [ProductName] privacy policy for marketplace launch

- Comprehensive privacy policy at /[product-name]/privacy/
- [Key features: local-first, OAuth, etc.]
- GDPR, CCPA, COPPA compliant
- Required for [marketplace names]
- Effective date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

Blocking: [ProductName] v[X.Y.Z] launch
Ref: CC-WEB deployment pattern"

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment (8 min)
```bash
# Wait 30-60 seconds for GitHub Pages
sleep 30

# Verify live
curl -sL https://www.lexopoly.com/[product-name]/privacy/ | grep "<title>"

# Check mobile responsiveness (optional)
curl -sL https://www.lexopoly.com/[product-name]/privacy/ | grep "viewport"

# Verify key sections present
curl -sL https://www.lexopoly.com/[product-name]/privacy/ | grep -E "(GDPR|CCPA|support@lexopoly)"
```

**Expected Result**:
- Page loads in <2 seconds
- Title shows correct product name
- Support email present
- Mobile viewport meta tag present

```

**Example Statements**:

- **Local-first app (no data collection)**: "Compliant - no data processing"
- **OAuth-only app**: "Compliant - no user data collection, OAuth tokens only"
- **Cloud sync app**: "Compliant - user can export/delete data anytime"
- **Analytics app**: "Compliant - anonymized data only, opt-out available"

## Post-Deployment Actions

### 1. Update Product Documentation

# Update product README with privacy policy URL
cd /home/rain/si8/[product-name]
nano README.md

# Add to checklist:
# - [x] **Privacy policy hosted**: https://www.lexopoly.com/[product-name]/privacy/
```

### 2. Update Marketplace Submissions
- **Clio App Directory**: Enter privacy policy URL in submission form
- **Google Play Console**: Enter privacy policy URL in Store Presence → Privacy Policy
- **Apple App Store**: Enter privacy policy URL in App Information → Privacy Policy URL

### 3. Log to Super Bus
```bash
cat >> /home/rain/federation/ops/bus/LEXOPOLY_SUPER_BUS.jsonl << EOF
{"timestamp":"[ISO8601]","agent":"CC-WEB","type":"DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS","event":"[PRODUCT]_PRIVACY_POLICY_LIVE","details":{"url":"https://www.lexopoly.com/[product-name]/privacy/","deployment_time":"45min"},"impact":"[Product] v[X.Y.Z] unblocked for marketplace submissions"}
EOF
```

## Future Enhancements

**Optional (Not Critical Path)**:

1. **Privacy Policy Generator Script**: Auto-generate HTML from YAML config
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Spanish, French, etc. (if targeting international markets)
3. **Privacy Policy Versioning**: Maintain history of privacy policy changes
4. **User Consent Tracking**: If app requires explicit consent flows

## Related Federation Patterns

- **CC-WEB Spinup**: Product launch website support
- **AMAOP**: Asynchronous documentation for agent onboarding
- **CAAP**: Compliance-as-Architecture (privacy policy hosted = structural compliance)

---

## Key Learnings

**From QuoteCreator Launch (Oct 9, 2025)**:

1. **Privacy policy is ALWAYS critical path** - No exceptions for app store launches
2. **45 minutes is sufficient** - Don't over-engineer before market validation
3. **Template is highly reusable** - 90% of content applies to all products
4. **Mobile-first design essential** - Most users read privacy policies on phones
5. **OAuth sections critical** - Any app using third-party auth needs detailed OAuth explanation

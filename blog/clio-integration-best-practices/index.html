But when evaluating a new integration, specifically check whether the permission request includes trust account access. If an app requests trust_accounts:read or trust_accounts:write, ask the vendor why. Legitimate reasons include: accounting integrations syncing trust balances to QuickBooks, compliance tools auditing trust account rules, or trust-specific analytics dashboards. If the vendor can't articulate a clear reason, don't connect the app."

Revocation is immediate. Within seconds, the app's OAuth token becomes invalid and it can no longer access your Clio data."

Most legal malpractice policies cover professional errors (missed deadlines, incorrect advice) but exclude cyber liability (data breaches, ransomware, third-party security failures). If a Clio integration vendor suffers a data breach that exposes your client data, your standard malpractice policy probably won't cover it. You might need a separate cyber liability insurance policy that specifically covers third-party vendor breaches. Action Step: Email your malpractice carrier to ask if third-party app breaches are covered and get their answer in writing."

If you authorized calendar access only, hackers can see calendar event titles but not documents, trust accounts, or communications. If you authorized full account access, they can see everything. This is why following Clio integration best practices matters. Minimal permissions limit the damage from a vendor breach."

In California (CCPA) and Europe (GDPR), you generally need client consent before sharing their data with third parties—including Clio integrations.

We vet these tools for security and data protection.' Consult your local bar association ethics hotline for jurisdiction-specific guidance."

                <p>Every Clio integration is a doorway into your client data. Some doors have deadbolts. Others are propped open with a stick.</p>

                <p>Law firms increasingly integrate Clio with third-party applications to automate billing, track time, manage documents, and analyze practice metrics. The promise is compelling: connect once, <a href="../manual-time-entry-law-firms/">automate time entry forever</a>. But most lawyers blindly click "Connect to Clio" without understanding what permissions they're granting or what data they're exposing.</p>

                <p>The assumption is simple: "If Clio approved it for their <a href="https://app.clio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Directory</a>, it must be safe." That's partially true. Clio vets applications for technical security standards, but following Clio integration best practices means understanding that they don't determine which permissions your firm actually needs. An app might have passed Clio's security review while still requesting access to trust account balances when all it needs is your calendar.</p>

                <p>This creates a silent risk. Your malpractice insurance covers legal errors, not data breaches caused by poorly configured third-party integrations. Your client engagement letters promise confidentiality, but third-party apps might store client data on servers you've never audited. And if you practice in California, Europe, or other privacy-regulated jurisdictions, you're personally liable for how client data flows through your tech stack.</p>

                <p>The ABA recognized this problem in 2012 when they amended <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model Rule 1.1, Comment [8]</a> to require lawyers maintain "the requisite knowledge and skill" including understanding "the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology." Clicking "Connect to Clio" without reading the permission request may not meet these ethics requirements.</p>

                <p>This guide explains Clio integration best practices in plain English. You'll learn how OAuth 2.0 (the secure connection system) works, what app permissions mean, and five actionable security practices. We'll examine RevenueRescue as a case study, identify common security wins, and answer frequently asked questions. By the end, you'll evaluate Clio integrations like a security professional, without needing a computer science degree.</p>

                <h2>Understanding App Connections to Clio</h2>

                <p>When you click "Connect to Clio," you're granting a third-party app permission to access specific parts of your Clio account. This connection system (called OAuth 2.0) works like a hotel key card: the app gets limited access to certain resources, never sees your password, and you can revoke access anytime.</p>

                <h3 id="what-you-need-to-know">What You Need to Know</h3>

                <p>When evaluating Clio integrations, focus on these key security principles:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apps never see your password.</strong> You always log in through Clio's official website, not the third-party app.</li>
                    <li><strong>You control what each app can access.</strong> Apps request specific permissions (like "read calendar" or "create time entries"), and you approve or deny each request.</li>
                    <li><strong>Some permissions are riskier than others.</strong> Calendar access is low risk. Trust account access is very high risk. Documents and communications are moderate to high risk depending on your practice area.</li>
                    <li><strong>You can disconnect anytime.</strong> Go to Clio Settings → Integrations and revoke access instantly. No need to contact the app vendor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Read-only is safer than write access.</strong> Apps that can only read data can't modify, delete, or create records in your Clio account.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The key question when evaluating any Clio integration: Does this app need the permissions it's requesting to deliver the features I'll actually use?</p>

                <h2>Five Best Practices for Secure Clio Integrations</h2>

                <p>Now that you understand OAuth fundamentals, let's apply them. These five Clio integration best practices will help you balance automation benefits with security risks.</p>

                <div class="best-practice">
                    <h3 id="best-practice-1">Best Practice #1: Only Install Clio App Directory Apps</h3>

                    <p>Clio maintains an official App Directory at app.clio.com featuring vetted third-party integrations. Apps in this directory have passed Clio's security review, which includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OAuth 2.0 implementation audit (proper token handling, secure storage)</li>
                        <li>Data encryption requirements (data in transit and at rest)</li>
                        <li>Privacy policy review (data retention, deletion, sharing practices)</li>
                        <li>Ongoing monitoring (Clio can revoke directory listing if security declines)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If an app isn't in the Clio App Directory, it hasn't passed these checks. You're betting your client data security on an unvetted vendor.</p>

                    <p>Some vendors claim "We're Clio-compatible but not in the App Directory yet" or "We're in the approval process." This is a red flag. Clio's approval process takes several weeks for legitimate vendors. If an app has been "in review" for six months, either they failed the security audit or never submitted for review.</p>

                    <div class="action-step">
                        <strong>Action Step:</strong> Before connecting any app to Clio, search <a href="https://app.clio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app.clio.com</a>. If you don't find it there, don't connect it. If you absolutely must use a non-directory app, consult your malpractice carrier first and document the business justification in writing.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="best-practice">
                    <h3 id="best-practice-2">Best Practice #2: Read Permission Requests Carefully</h3>

                    <p>When you click "Connect to Clio," slow down and read the permission request screen. This simple step is one of the most important Clio integration best practices. It's your only opportunity to see what the app is requesting before granting access.</p>

                    <p>Ask three questions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Does this app need these permissions?</strong> A time-tracking app needs <code>calendar:read</code> (permission to view your calendar) and <code>activities:write</code> (ability to create time entries), but why would it need <code>documents:read</code> (access to uploaded documents)?</li>
                        <li><strong>Is this read-only or read-write?</strong> Read-only access like <code>calendar:read</code> (can view but not modify) is safer than write access like <code>billing:write</code> (can create or modify invoices). Apps can't corrupt data they can't modify.</li>
                        <li><strong>What's the access level?</strong> Some apps request specific permissions (like calendar only), others request extensive access (entire account).</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Example: A time-tracking app might request calendar and matter access to detect unbilled time, but not billing or trust account access. Look for apps that use approval workflows before writing data to your Clio account.</p>

                    <div class="action-step">
                        <strong>Action Step:</strong> Take a screenshot of every permission request screen before approving. Store these screenshots in your IT documentation. If the app ever acts strangely or a data breach occurs, you'll have proof of what you authorized.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="best-practice">
                    <h3 id="best-practice-3">Best Practice #3: Prefer Read-Only Integrations When Possible</h3>

                    <p>Read-only integrations (apps that request only <code>*:read</code> permissions) are inherently safer than read-write integrations. If an app can't write data to Clio, it can't:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accidentally delete matters or contacts</li>
                        <li>Create incorrect invoices or time entries</li>
                        <li>Modify trust account balances</li>
                        <li>Corrupt your Clio database</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Of course, many valuable integrations require write access. Billing automation apps need <code>activities:write</code> to create time entries. Document management systems need <code>documents:write</code> to store files. The key is to prefer read-only when the app's function doesn't strictly require writes.</p>

                    <p>For example, analytics dashboards should only need read access. If a "practice management analytics" app requests <code>billing:write</code> or <code>trust_accounts:write</code>, that's suspicious. Why would a reporting tool need to modify financial data?</p>

                    <p>When write access is necessary, look for apps with approval workflows. Apps that show you a preview and require manual approval before writing data to Clio give you an extra safety layer. You retain final control over what gets written to your Clio account.</p>

                        <strong>Action Step:</strong> Audit your current Clio integrations. Identify which ones have write access. For each, ask: "Could this app deliver its value with read-only access?" If yes, contact the vendor to downgrade permissions.

                    <p>OAuth tokens don't expire automatically. Once you connect an app to Clio, it retains access until you explicitly revoke it, even if you stop using the app.</p>

                    <p>This creates "zombie integrations": apps you tried months ago, decided not to use, but never disconnected. These apps still have active OAuth tokens silently accessing your Clio data in the background.</p>

                    <p>Set a calendar reminder for the first Monday of every quarter (January, April, July, October) to audit connected apps:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Log into Clio</li>
                        <li>Navigate to Settings → Integrations</li>
                        <li>Review the list of connected apps</li>
                        <li>For each app, ask: "Are we actively using this?" and "Does this app still need access?"</li>
                        <li>Revoke access to any app you're not actively using</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This quarterly audit catches abandoned trials, deprecated tools, and vendor consolidations. If you switched from App A to App B six months ago but never disconnected App A, you're exposing client data to a service you no longer use.</p>

                    <div class="action-step">
                        <strong>Action Step:</strong> Schedule a quarterly 15-minute meeting with your IT admin or practice manager titled "Clio Integration Audit." Review the connected apps list together and revoke unused integrations.

                    <p>When an employee leaves your firm (voluntarily or involuntarily), most firms remember to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disable their Clio user account</li>
                        <li>Collect their laptop and phone</li>
                        <li>Change passwords for shared accounts</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But they forget to revoke OAuth tokens for apps that were connected using the departing employee's Clio credentials.</p>

                    <p>If an employee connected a third-party app to Clio using their account, that OAuth token might remain active even after their Clio user account is disabled (depending on how the integration was configured). The employee might still be able to access firm data through the third-party app.</p>

                    <p>Create a written protocol for employee departures:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Day 1 (Immediate):</strong> Disable Clio user account</li>
                        <li><strong>Day 1 (Within 2 hours):</strong> Review Settings → Integrations for any apps connected by the departing employee and revoke access</li>
                        <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Audit third-party apps directly (log into each app and remove the employee's user account)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="action-step">
                        <strong>Action Step:</strong> Add "Revoke OAuth tokens for departing employee" to your offboarding checklist. Assign this task to a specific role (IT admin, practice manager, managing partner) so it doesn't fall through the cracks.

                <p>Let's examine RevenueRescue as a case study for Clio integration best practices. This isn't a sales pitch. It's an educational example of how a billing automation app can deliver value while requesting minimal OAuth permissions.</p>

                <div class="disclaimer">
                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This case study analyzes RevenueRescue's security posture to illustrate OAuth best practices. We're affiliated with RevenueRescue, so treat this as educational content, not an unbiased product review.
                </div>

                <h3 id="what-revenuerescue-does">What RevenueRescue Does</h3>

                <p>RevenueRescue monitors your Clio calendar for potential unbilled time—client meetings, court appearances, phone calls—and generates billing suggestions. Most firms <a href="../law-firm-revenue-loss/">lose $15,000-$40,000 annually to unbilled time</a>, and RevenueRescue helps recover this revenue. You review billing suggestions in a dashboard and approve or reject them with one click. Approved suggestions become time entries in Clio.</p>

                <p>This workflow requires RevenueRescue to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Read your calendar to detect billable events</li>
                    <li>Read matter details to associate events with clients</li>
                    <li>Show you billing suggestions (processed server-side, not stored)</li>
                    <li>Create time entries in Clio (only after your explicit approval)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 id="permissions-requested">Permissions Requested: Read vs Write Access</h3>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3>RevenueRescue Clio Permissions</h3>
                    <p>RevenueRescue requests the following permissions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>Activities</code> - Read/Write (create time entries after your approval)</li>
                        <li><code>Calendars</code> - Read (detect potential billable time)</li>
                        <li><code>Communications</code> - Read (detect billable client communications)</li>
                        <li><code>Contacts</code> - Read (associate activities with clients)</li>
                        <li><code>Custom Fields</code> - Read (read matter custom fields)</li>
                        <li><code>Documents</code> - Read (analyze document activity patterns)</li>
                        <li><code>Matters</code> - Read (associate events with client matters)</li>
                        <li><code>Users</code> - Read (identify which attorney worked on each matter)</li>
                        <li><code>Tasks</code> - Read (detect task completion for billing)</li>
                        <li><code>Webhooks</code> - Read/Write (receive real-time updates from Clio)</li>
                        <li><code>Custom Actions</code> - Read/Write (enable quick actions in Clio interface)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>Key security features:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most permissions are read-only (8 of 11)</li>
                        <li>Write permissions require your manual approval first</li>
                        <li>No access to billing records or trust accounts</li>
                        <li>No ability to modify or delete existing data</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Note that while RevenueRescue requests several read permissions, the write permissions (Activities, Webhooks, Custom Actions) only execute after you manually approve each suggestion in the dashboard. This approval workflow gives you final control over what gets written to your Clio account.</p>

                <p>When evaluating any app, focus on: (1) Does each permission support a feature you'll actually use? (2) Are write permissions protected by approval workflows? (3) Does the app access trust accounts or billing records?</p>

                <h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters for Your Firm</h3>

                <p>Apps with limited write access mean the potential damage from a breach is smaller. Even if servers were compromised, read-only permissions prevent attackers from modifying or deleting your data. They also prevent access to the most sensitive areas like trust accounts and billing records.</p>

                <p>When evaluating apps, ask: Does this app request access to billing records or trust accounts? If yes, does it actually need that access for the features I'll use?</p>

                <h3 id="data-handling">Data Handling: Server-Side Processing</h3>

                <p>RevenueRescue analyzes your calendar to suggest billing entries, then discards the calendar data. Only approved time entries are saved to Clio. This minimizes data retention risk—no permanent archive of your calendar history that could be subpoenaed or breached.</p>

                <h3 id="user-control">User Control: Revocable Anytime</h3>

                <p>Like all Clio App Directory integrations, you can revoke RevenueRescue's access instantly from Clio Settings → Integrations. Revocation is immediate—within seconds, RevenueRescue's OAuth token becomes invalid and the app can no longer access your Clio data.</p>

                <p>This case study illustrates how following Clio integration best practices benefits both vendors (smaller attack surface, easier security audits) and customers (reduced data exposure, faster security reviews).</p>

                <h2>5 Quick Security Wins</h2>

                <p>Implement these five security optimizations to strengthen your Clio integration security:</p>

                <div class="mistake-box">
                    <h3>Security Win #1: Challenge "Full Account Access" Requests</h3>

                    <p>Many apps request broad permissions like "Full account access" or "All resources: read and write." These permission requests are lazy app design. A well-architected app requests only the specific permissions it needs.</p>

                    <p>When you see "Full account access," ask the vendor: "Can you configure this integration with more limited permissions? We only need [specific feature]." Reputable vendors will work with you to reduce permissions. Vendors who refuse are either technically incompetent (they hardcoded broad permissions) or deliberately overreaching (they want access to data they don't need).</p>

                    <div class="fix-box">
                        <strong>Action:</strong> Never approve "Full account access" without written justification from the vendor explaining why each requested permission is necessary. If they can't justify it, find a different app.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="mistake-box">
                    <h3>Security Win #2: Audit Connected Apps Quarterly</h3>

                    <p>The average law firm connects 5-7 apps to Clio over three years but only actively uses 3-4 at any given time. That means 30-40% of connected apps are "zombie integrations"—authorized but unused.</p>

                    <p>Firms forget about trial apps they tested and abandoned, tools that were replaced by better alternatives, and integrations configured by former employees. All of these zombie integrations retain active OAuth access until explicitly revoked.</p>

                    <div class="fix-box">
                        <strong>Action:</strong> Implement the quarterly audit protocol from Best Practice #4. Every 90 days, review Settings → Integrations and revoke anything you're not actively using.

                <div class="mistake-box">
                    <h3>Security Win #3: Only Use Clio App Directory Apps</h3>

                    <p>Some vendors build "Clio-compatible" integrations but never submit for App Directory approval. This is often because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They can't pass Clio's security review (failed encryption standards, poor OAuth implementation)</li>
                        <li>They don't want to pay Clio's App Directory fees (which fund the security vetting process)</li>
                        <li>They're too small/new to prioritize the approval process</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Whatever the reason, using non-directory apps means you're trusting your client data to an unvetted vendor. If that vendor suffers a breach and your clients sue you for negligence, "But they were Clio-compatible!" won't protect you from liability.</p>

                    <div class="fix-box">
                        <strong>Action:</strong> Only connect apps listed in the official Clio App Directory (app.clio.com). If a vendor isn't listed, ask when they expect directory approval. If they say "We're not pursuing directory approval," that's a red flag.

                    <p>OAuth security depends on individual user accounts with individual OAuth tokens. When firms share a single "admin" Clio login across multiple staff members, they lose:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Audit trails (can't determine who authorized which integration)</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Only install Clio App Directory apps (vetted security)</li>
                    <li>Read permission requests carefully (least privilege)</li>
                    <li>Prefer read-only integrations when possible (reduced blast radius)</li>
                    <li>Audit connected apps quarterly (eliminate zombie integrations)</li>
                    <li>Implement immediate revocation protocol (employee offboarding)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>These practices take 15 minutes per quarter and significantly reduce your firm's data exposure risk.</p>

                <h3>Action Steps for Today</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Audit Now:</strong> Log into Clio → Settings → Integrations. Review every connected app. Revoke anything you're not actively using.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Check that all connected apps appear in the official Clio App Directory (app.clio.com)</li>
                    <li><strong>Review:</strong> Look at the permissions each app has. Do any have broader access than they need?</li>
                    <li><strong>Revoke:</strong> Disconnect any apps that request permissions they don't justify</li>
                    <li><strong>Document:</strong> Screenshot your current integrations list and store it in your IT documentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Set a quarterly calendar reminder for your next Clio integration audit</li>
                </ol>

**Results**: All tests passed, performance excellent

### **TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE**
```
✅ AUTOMATED SCREENSHOT CAPTURE:
- Homepage, Demo, Signup, Pricing, Lawyers, Journalists, About
- Desktop (1920x1080), Tablet (768x1024), Mobile (375x667)

### **CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM TESTING**
```
🚨 IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:
1. Demo Page: "Interactive Demo Coming Soon" placeholder (unprofessional)
2. Signup Page: Still shows "Free Account" messaging (business model confusion)
3. Emoji Overuse: Consumer-style emojis on professional B2B site
4. Pricing Inconsistency: Multiple pricing figures across pages

✅ CONFIRMED WORKING:
- All navigation flows function correctly

- Page load performance excellent (<600ms avg)
- CTA buttons lead to correct destinations
- Form layouts work on all screen sizes
```

### **PROFESSIONAL DESIGN AUDIT RESULTS**
**Conclusion**: Website functions well but **appears too consumer-focused** for legal professionals

- Unicode arrows (→) instead of professional styling

**Recommendation**: Implement professional design improvements to match enterprise legal software expectations

## üìù DETAILED SCRIPT

### **INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)**
**[Screen: LocalTranscribe homepage]**

**Narrator**: "Welcome to LocalTranscribe - the privacy-first transcription solution designed specifically for legal professionals. In the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how LocalTranscribe transforms audio recordings into professional documents in three simple steps."

**[Screen: Transition to application interface]**

**Narrator**: "Let's dive right into a typical workflow that legal professionals use every day."

---

### **STEP 1: DOCUMENT UPLOAD (0:30 - 1:30)**
**[Screen: Main application interface - upload area]**

**Narrator**: "Step one - uploading your audio or video file. This could be a client consultation, deposition recording, or court proceeding."

**[Action: Drag and drop audio file OR click upload button]**

**Narrator**: "LocalTranscribe accepts all common audio formats - MP3, WAV, M4A - as well as video files if you need to extract audio from video recordings."

**[Screen: File upload progress indicator]**

**Narrator**: "Notice that your audio file is processed entirely on your local device. This means sensitive attorney-client communications never leave your computer - ensuring complete privacy and HIPAA compliance."

**[Screen: Processing status indicator]**

**Narrator**: "Processing begins immediately. LocalTranscribe uses advanced speech recognition that's been optimized for legal terminology and professional language."

### **STEP 2: QUALITY REVIEW (1:30 - 3:30)**
**[Screen: Transcription review interface]**

**Narrator**: "Step two - quality review and editing. Here's where LocalTranscribe really shines for legal professionals."

**[Screen: Split view with audio waveform and transcription text]**

**Narrator**: "The interface presents your transcription alongside the audio waveform. You can click on any section of text to jump to that exact moment in the audio."

**[Action: Click on text, audio jumps to that timestamp]**

**Narrator**: "This makes fact-checking and accuracy verification incredibly efficient. Let's make a quick edit to ensure perfect accuracy."

**[Action: Edit a section of text - perhaps correcting a legal term or name]**

**Narrator**: "Legal names, case references, and technical terms can be easily corrected. The system learns from your edits to improve accuracy on future transcriptions."

**[Screen: Highlight confidence indicators or uncertain words]**

**Narrator**: "LocalTranscribe identifies areas where it's less certain about the transcription, so you can focus your review time on the sections that matter most."

**[Action: Review and approve different sections]**

**Narrator**: "Once you're satisfied with the accuracy - and this typically takes just a few minutes for most recordings - you're ready for the final step."

### **STEP 3: PDF EXPORT (3:30 - 4:30)**
**[Screen: Export options interface]**

**Narrator**: "Step three - generating your professional PDF document. LocalTranscribe offers several formatting options designed specifically for legal use."

**[Screen: PDF format options - legal brief, deposition format, etc.]**

**Narrator**: "Choose from templates like deposition transcripts, client interview summaries, or general legal documents. Each format includes appropriate headers, page numbers, and professional styling."

**[Action: Select format option]**

**Narrator**: "Add case information, client details, and your firm letterhead if desired."

**[Screen: Document settings - case number, date, participants]**

**[Action: Fill in document metadata]**

**Narrator**: "Click generate, and within seconds you have a professionally formatted PDF ready for your case file or client delivery."

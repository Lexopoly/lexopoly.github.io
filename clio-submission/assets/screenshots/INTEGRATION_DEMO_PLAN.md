## üîß TECHNICAL DEMONSTRATION APPROACH

### **GAMMA System Access**
**Current Status Check**:
```bash
# VPS API Health Check
curl -s --connect-timeout 5 http://165.227.115.116/health
# Expected: Working or need SSH key restoration
```

**If VPS Available**:
- Direct demonstration of working OAuth flow
- Real-time integration capability proof
- Live API integration screenshots

**If VPS Unavailable**:
- Local GAMMA demonstration (if available)
- Documentation-based integration proof
- Architecture diagram with technical specifications

### **Integration Flow Documentation**
1. **OAuth Initiation**: Clean authorization request
2. **Clio Authorization**: Professional permission request
3. **Callback Handling**: Secure token exchange
4. **API Integration**: Working Clio data access

## üé• INTEGRATION VIDEO SEGMENT

### **Technical Competence Demo (90 seconds)**
**Script Outline**:
```
"LocalTranscribe integrates seamlessly with Clio Manage through enterprise-grade OAuth 2.0 authentication."

[Show OAuth initiation]
"The integration process is simple and secure - users authorize LocalTranscribe through Clio's standard OAuth flow."

[Show Clio authorization screen]
"Clio presents the standard authorization request, ensuring users maintain full control over their data access."

[Show successful integration]
"Once authorized, LocalTranscribe maintains secure, session-based access that respects all Clio security protocols."

[Show API capability]
"This enables seamless document management and professional workflow integration."
```

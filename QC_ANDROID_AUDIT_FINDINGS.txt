=== HOMEPAGE AUDIT (2025-10-25) ===
index.html:1394:                    <p>Create professional estimates on Android and upload them directly to Clio matters with one tap. Built for legal professionals and service providers.</p>
index.html:1396:                        <li>Fast mobile estimate creation</li>
index.html:1399:                        <li>Works offline</li>

CRITICAL: Homepage product description explicitly mentions "on Android" - needs update to "in your browser" or "on the web"
MINOR: "Fast mobile estimate creation" should be "Fast estimate creation" (works on desktop too)
MINOR: "Works offline" is technically accurate for PWA but may confuse users expecting Android app

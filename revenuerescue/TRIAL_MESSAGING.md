## FAQs for Trial Users

### Q: What data do I see during the trial?
**A:** Your trial analyzes the last 30 days of Clio calendar activity. You'll see:
- Summary metrics (total estimated revenue leakage)
- High-level analytics
- 3 anonymized sample billing opportunities

Paid subscription ($149/month) provides unlimited access to full calendar history, complete detailed analytics, and unlimited billing suggestions with full client details.

---

### Q: Do I need a credit card to start the trial?
**A:** Yes, credit card required to start your 7-day trial. This is standard practice to prevent abuse while keeping the trial genuinely free. **You won't be charged during the 7-day trial period.** If you cancel within 7 days, your card is never charged. After 7 days, billing automatically starts at $149/month unless you cancel.

---

### Q: What happens after 7 days?
**A:** Your trial access ends after 7 days. To continue:
1. **Upgrade to paid subscription** ($149/month) - Get immediate access to full features
2. **Let trial expire** - Your account becomes inactive, but we save your settings if you want to reactivate later

No automatic charges - you decide if you want to continue.

---

### Q: Why only 30 days of data in the trial?
**A:** The 30-day window gives you enough data to validate revenue leakage and understand ROI, while keeping trial scope focused.

Most firms discover $15K-$40K in annual revenue leakage from just 30 days of analysis. That's enough to make an informed decision.

Paid subscription provides unlimited access to full calendar history plus ongoing monitoring forever.

---

### Q: Can I extend my trial?
**A:** Trials are 7 days (fixed). However, we're happy to:
- Answer questions: [Contact Support]

## Key Messaging Principles (Layer 4: Ongoing Value)

### Core Message
**The trial shows you what you've been losing. The subscription ensures you stop losing it going forward.**

### Ongoing Value Themes
1. **Trial = Snapshot**: Limited 30-day window to validate problem
2. **Paid = Continuous**: Unlimited history + ongoing monitoring forever
3. **Value Compounds**: The longer you use RevenueRescue, the more valuable it becomes
4. **Time Perspective**: Trial looks backward (30 days). Subscription captures forward (forever).

### Avoid These Phrases
- ‚ùå "Trial limitations" (negative framing)
- ‚ùå "Upgrade to unlock" (implies trial is inferior)
- ‚ùå "Full features" (implies trial is incomplete)

### Use These Phrases Instead
- ‚úÖ "Trial validates potential, subscription captures it"
- ‚úÖ "Ongoing value that compounds over time"
- ‚úÖ "Stop losing revenue forever"
- ‚úÖ "Real-time monitoring going forward"
